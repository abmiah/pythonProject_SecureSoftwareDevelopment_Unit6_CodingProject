The Best - Song lyrics
… I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire
You come to me, come to me wild and wild
When you come to me
Give me everything I need
… Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
Speak a language of love like you know what it means
Mmm, and it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong, baby
… You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
… I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart
Baby, I would rather be dead
… In your heart, I see the star of every night and every day
In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place
… You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
… Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Don't tear us apart, no, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead
… Each time you leave me, I start losing control
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when I'm alone
Oh baby, don't let go
… Ooh, you're the best, ooh
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
… Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Don't tear us apart, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead
You're the best
… Ooh, you're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
… I'm stuck on your heart, baby
I hang on every word you say
Don't tear us apart, no, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead
… Oh, you're the best
You're better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
Ooh, you're the best
